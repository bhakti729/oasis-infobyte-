                <h2>BHAKTI JARE</h2>
                <p>Upon entering I was an inexperienced person who had never worked in a team or project before, 
                    but after a few days of exposure, I felt a little more confident in understanding how to work.
                     Technical education so far has been technology-savvy. I didn't know how to make attractive
                      presentations or what color combinations would work for the text in the app. I'm sure I'm 
                      doing better now than I was on day one. Soft skills like meeting protocol, office manners
                      , how to work with fellow interns, reporting daily chores to in charge were never taught to me. 
                      Many people are guiding me in learning all this, including Rutuja madam and Sudhir sir. Apart from work, 
                      Rutuja Madam organized various sessions, gave us activities like personal essays and skill extraction. He also 
                      shared his IT expertise and his experiences.
                    These types of activities are extremely helpful in creating resumes. I would say that the experiences I have gaine
                    d from performing daily tasks and attending meetings will benefit me in my future career. 
                    My internship so far has been a great learning experience. I have learned to be punctual, persistent, hardworking,
                     as well as a smart worker.</p>

             <p> 
                Image result for what is website design
                Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet.
                It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather 
                than software development. ... A web designer works on the appearance, layout,
                and, in some cases, content of a website.

             <p>User Experience Design is the process of creating evidence-based, interaction 
                 designs between human users and products or websites. Design decisions in UX 
                 Design are driven by research, data analysis, and test results rather than aesthetic
                 preferences and opinions.
